##### Host your portfolio or projects using Github pages and Jekyll.
You can host simple sites that run scripts such as javascript on client server without worrying about backend services, such as Databases or
Server Side scripting. 

#### So What is Jekyll?
Jekyll is a static site generator which builds simple, minimal style websites. It reads the rich text files written
in Markdown to a full ready to be published static site on Github Pages. One of the best features of Jekyll is that you 
can create and host your own blog very easily. 

#### What are Github Pages?
Github pages simply hosts your static site for free. With Github pages you can host a website for your project or portfolio for free.
Your pages are saved in a github repository. 

#### How do they fit together?
Jekyll parces your Markdown content through the pre-built theme templates, and spits out the complete static Html Code. Github pages simply hosts the spit out
html. Using these two together you can maintain and host your site easily without worrying about other complexities of hosting and finding a reasonable priced hosting provider.

My blog itself is hosted on Github pages.
